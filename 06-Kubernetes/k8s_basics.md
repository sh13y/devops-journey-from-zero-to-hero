# Kubernetes Basics

This document covers the basic concepts of Kubernetes.

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Concepts
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- **Node**: A worker machine in Kubernetes.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes managed by Kubernetes.
- **Deployment**: A resource that defines how to deploy and manage pods.
- **Service**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them.
