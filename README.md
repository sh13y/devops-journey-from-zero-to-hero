## 📖 About This Repo  

1. **Accountability**: Tracks my progress and keeps me focused (instead of bingeing cat videos 🐱).  
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: If I can learn it, so can you!  
3. **Proof of Work**: A place to showcase progress to potential employers and collaborators.  

This repository is based on the **DevOps Roadmap**, covering every essential skill, tool, and concept.
