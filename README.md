## 📖 About This Repo  

This repository is where I document my transformation from "What’s a DevOps?" to "I AM DevOps!" It’s packed with goals, resources, and a dash of humor to keep me sane along the way.  

1. **Accountability**: Tracks my progress and keeps me focused (instead of watching funny cat videos 🐱).  
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: If I can figure this out, so can you!  
3. **Proof of Work**: Hey, recruiters, look at all this effort!

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Covered  

Here’s the lineup of awesomeness I’ll be tackling:  
- **Linux**: The backbone of DevOps (and the bane of Windows users).  
- **Networking**: Making computers talk without arguing.  
- **Git**: Because manually tracking code changes is for masochists.  
- **Python**: Automating the boring stuff like a pro.  
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, GCP – the gods of the internet.  
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containers and orchestration for the deployment circus.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Making sure the code doesn't break while we sleep.  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Because configuring servers manually is *so* last decade.  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Knowing when things go boom (and why).

## 📝 To-Do List  

Here’s my step-by-step journey with some snark to keep things interesting:  

### 🟢 **Beginner Level: Where the Madness Begins**  

1. **Linux Fundamentals (2-3 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Learn how to tell Linux to "ls" instead of "list files like a normal human."  
   - [ ] Get cozy with file hierarchies like `/`, `/home`, and that mysterious `/var` folder.  
   - [ ] Master permissions (`chmod`) so you can say, "I *own* this file."  
   - [ ] Channel your inner hacker with `ps`, `top`, and `kill`.  
   - [ ] Manage packages (`apt` and `yum`), aka the Linux app stores for geeks.  
   - [ ] Write shell scripts that make you feel like a wizard casting `bash` spells.  

2. **Networking Concepts (2 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Decode the OSI model: It’s not a spy agency, we promise.  
   - [ ] Subnetting: Because dividing IPs is cooler than splitting pizzas.  
   - [ ] Learn why DNS is the internet’s ultimate phonebook.  
   - [ ] Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to find out why the network hates you.  
   - [ ] Set up firewalls (`iptables`, `UFW`) because the internet is a scary place.  

3. **Git Gud with Git (1-2 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Clone like a Jedi (`git clone`).  
   - [ ] Commit your sins to history (`git commit`).  
   - [ ] Push your problems to GitHub (`git push`).  
   - [ ] Merge and resolve conflicts like a relationship counselor.  
   - [ ] Learn workflows like GitHub Flow—because "winging it" isn’t a workflow.  

4. **Python: Because Every DevOps Engineer Needs a Sidekick (4-6 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Learn the basics: Variables, loops, and how to make Python say “Hello, World!”  
   - [ ] Write scripts to automate boring stuff like… everything.  
   - [ ] Scrape the web (legally!) with BeautifulSoup.  
   - [ ] Use `try` and `except` to handle errors, like when the code forgets to cooperate.

### 🟠 **Intermediate Level: Now It’s Getting Real**  

5. **Cloud Providers (3-4 weeks)**  
   - [ ] AWS: Master EC2 (fancy word for "virtual computers").  
   - [ ] Store cat pictures in S3 (object storage) because why not?  
   - [ ] Lock down access with IAM. No, it’s not a rapper name.  
   - [ ] Learn serverless magic with Lambda, aka “Functions in the Cloud™.”  

6. **Docker: Containerize All the Things! (3-4 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Learn how to say, "It works on my machine!" and actually mean it.  
   - [ ] Build Docker images—because normal pictures are boring.  
   - [ ] Use Docker Compose to juggle multiple containers like a circus pro.  

7. **CI/CD: The Automation Wonderland (3-4 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Install Jenkins, the butler of CI/CD.  
   - [ ] Create pipelines that do the boring stuff for you.  
   - [ ] Write Jenkinsfiles so fancy, they’ll win pipeline Oscars.  

8. **Kubernetes: Master of the Clusterverse (4-6 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Deploy pods, services, and other mystical Kubernetes things.  
   - [ ] Use Helm to orchestrate containers like a symphony conductor.  
   - [ ] Scale your app so it survives Black Friday-level traffic.

### 🔴 **Advanced Level: The Big Leagues**  

9. **Networking Services (3-4 weeks)**  
   - [ ] Use Nginx to proxy all the things.  
   - [ ] Set up caching so your app loads faster than a cat video.  
   - [ ] Configure SSL because "HTTP is scary, HTTPS is classy."  

10. **Configuration Management: Herding Cats (3-4 weeks)**  
    - [ ] Write Ansible playbooks that make servers behave.  
    - [ ] Manage variables like you’re organizing a chaotic fridge.  
    - [ ] Try Puppet and Chef—if you’re brave enough.  

11. **Infrastructure as Code (3-4 weeks)**  
    - [ ] Terraform your way to infrastructure automation glory.  
    - [ ] Manage your Terraform state like a pro.  
    - [ ] Use modules so you’re not reinventing the wheel every time.  

12. **Monitoring and Logging: The All-Seeing Eye (3-4 weeks)**  
    - [ ] Use Prometheus to monitor your servers like a hawk.  
    - [ ] Create Grafana dashboards so pretty, you’ll hang them on your wall.  
    - [ ] Learn the ELK stack, aka “logs, logs everywhere.”

## 🏁 **Final Boss Level**  
- [ ] Build a project that makes everyone say, “Whoa, they know their stuff!”  
- [ ] Apply for DevOps roles or conquer open-source projects.  
- [ ] Keep learning because DevOps tools age faster than milk left in the sun.
